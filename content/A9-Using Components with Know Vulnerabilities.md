title: A9-Using Components with Know Vulnerabilities
date: 1497804944000
description: Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.

## Summary

When an organization has a breach, you would like to imagine that the attacker crafted a new exploit, leveraging a zero-day vulnerability that no one has any protection against. However, It is far more likely that the attacker exploited well-known vulnerabilities that may have been residing within their systems for months, if not years.  Attackers run automated scripts to probe web apps for known vulnerabilities and then exploit the weaknesses discovered. A vast majority of attackers are not going to invest the time and effort to design a custom exploit to break into your systems. Especially if they can find security flaws within one of your applications or applicationâ€™s dependencies easily.
